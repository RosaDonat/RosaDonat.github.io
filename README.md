## Work Experience
**Software Engineer @ Apogee Research LLC (_Aug 2022 - Aug 2023_)**
- Developed a plan to improve usability and increase tool adoption by conducting user surveys and analyzing user workflows.
- Quickly came up to speed in Java, Bash scripting and the STITCHES tool codebase to develop back-end features and front-end user interfaces.

**Simulation SW Engineer and Group Manager @ Aurora Flight Sciences (_Feb 2011 - July 2022_)**
- Supported all aspects of simulation SW development - model-based design, test scripting, interface definition, hw/sw integration and system testing - for various programs.
- Authored test plans and procedures for on-board diagnostic systems such as the system-wide contingency management system.
- Planned system test efforts based on safety criteria obtained from system-wide failure mode analysis.
- Supported failure modes and robustness testing using tailored simulation platforms with fault insertion triggers.
- Used DOORs to manage airworthiness certification requirements and artifacts.
- Worked with Systems Engineering team to define high level simulator design and test requirements.
- Concept development and proposal efforts for on-board diagnostic and situational awareness systems.
- Managed a team of 7 SW engineers and defined a technology roadmap for the SW integration and test efforts at Aurora.

**Systems Engineer @ Naval Air Systems Command (_Jan 2010 - Feb 2011_)**
- Provided technical oversight to unmanned air system radar and EO/IR sensors in accordance with systems engineering principles to mitigate performance, cost, and schedule risks.
- Approved contractual technical proposals to ensure requirements coverage.
- Developed radar and EO/IR sensor performance requirements, risk mitigation strategies, and verification and validation methods.

**Software Controls Engineer @ BAE Systems US Combat Systems (_Feb 2002 - Aug 2009_)**
- Used MATLAB tools to create plant models, design closed-loop PI controllers, implement fault checking, and target embedded control algorithms to real-time system for 29-axis automated ammunition handling system.
- Designed interface, controller, and fault checking logic for critical components including propellant laser igniter, cannon cooling system, and cannon breech mechanism, ensuring prototype was safe for field testing.
- Optimized hardware performance and validated fire mission timing by simulating drive performance using models and performing hardware-in-the-loop testing in a real-time test environment.
